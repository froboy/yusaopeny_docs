You write a section of content inside that block.\nYou can now embed that block on another page simply by typing its name and click on it from a list of results.\nSite-wide Blocks While you will not need to edit these that often, blocks can also be added and configured on a site-wide level using the Block Layout. These blocks contain certain features that are considered “Global”, such as your Menus.\nThemes are created with a set of Regions where certain section of content, or Blocks, can be placed. On a day-to-day basis, these regions are static in YMCA Website Services.\nTo view your site’s regions, head over to Structure \u003e Block Layout and click on Demonstrate block regions. It is not recommended to change the configuration in your Block Layout.\nTo change layouts in individual pieces of content, editors and website managers typically use Paragraphs or Layout Builder.\nParagraphs that support blocks will have two buttons - Add New Custom Block and Add Existing Custom Block.\nAdding a new custom block will allow you to retrieve it later on another page. When you go to retrieve a block, you will choose the Existing Custom Block option, type the Block Description in the search field, and choose from one of the options that appear.\nBlock Descriptions Standard across all block types is the block description field, which serves as the name for your block. Use this description field to help identify your block when you are embedding it onto a page.\nBlock Types YMCA Website Services not only allows you to use blocks, but it supports different types of blocks for different types of content.\nBasic Block A basic block gives you a basic text editor and that’s it. This is great for embedding descriptions on cards across multiple pages.\nSimple Block The block type you will likely use most often is the simple block.

Users can customize how content is arranged on a single page, across types of content, or even create custom landing pages with an easy-to-use drag-and-drop interface.\n- Layout Builder on Drupal.org\nGetting Started with Layout Builder YMCA Website Services 9.2.12 introduces a new Content Type: Landing Page (Layout Builder). This new page will allow you to build pages using Sections with different Layouts that contain Custom Blocks. Please contact your development partner if you need assistance updating the latest version.\nCreating a new page To use Layout Builder, you’ll first have to create a new page:\nGo to Content \u003e Add Content \u003e Landing Page (Layout Builder). This creation page will look different from others—there are no fields!\nSet a page Title and configure any Menu settings or URL alias that you’d like. Ensure that Published is unchecked. Then Save the page. Once you’ve saved, you will see an empty page. Click the Layout tab to enter Layout Builder.\nUpdating an existing page Navigate to the page you’d like to update, then click the Layout tab, like above.\nOnce you are in the Layout editor, you can create, edit, rearrange, and delete sections and blocks while viewing the page in a what-you-see-is-what-you-get preview mode.\nSaving and publishing Changes to the page are not displayed to site viewers until you Save Layout on the page and Publish it.\nWhen in the Layout editor, you will have these options at the top of the page:\nSave Layout Discard Changes Revert to Defaults will reset your page to an empty Header and Body section. After saving your changes, be sure your page is published:\nClick the Edit tab. Check Published. Save the page. Fundamentals In Layout Builder, you will see the page divided up into Sections and Blocks. Your page may already be populated with a Header and Body section to get you started building, and you can change or edit those to fit your page.\nSections Sections create the structure of the page and contain blocks. You can drag and drop blocks between sections, but you cannot move sections themselves—you can only create sections above or below existing sections.\nYou can remove sections by clicking the small “X” link at the top left of the section. Click on “Configure ” to edit the section layout and other options.\nLayouts Layouts define the structure of a section. YMCA Website Services comes with 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-column layouts, and each layout has additional configuration options once it’s created. See advanced options for more details.\nChoose a layout Then configure the advanced Layout, Styles, and Settings. Some options in this configuration may not yet be fully supported.\nBlocks While Sections contain the page’s structure, Blocks contain its content.\nTo create a block, click Add Block in any section of the page, then Create Custom Block.\nYour YMCA website has a wide array of blocks to choose from. In this section, you will find detailed descriptions of those blocks.\nTips and Tricks Get more space for writing The Content Editing Pane—the sidebar where you edit blocks —can sometimes be too small to get all of your content in there nicely. Simply drag anywhere on its left border to expand the pane.\nRearrange blocks easily When rearranging large blocks on the page it can often be challenging to drag them around. To make this easier, uncheck Show content preview at the top of the page. This will substitute the “WYSIWYG” preview for block titles, making the content much more compact.\nIf you run into a problem, get in touch.\nContent on this page is adapted from Drupal.org and Western Washington University\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Layout Builder is a powerful new page-building addition to your YMCA …","ref":"/docs/user-documentation/layout-builder/","tags":"","title":"Layout Builder"},{"body":"YMCA Website Services content editors use paragraphs to create unique layouts for their pages. Each paragraph is a section of content that comes with its own styling, functionality, and fields.\nYou can add a paragraph onto a page when you see the paragraphs dropdown field. These paragraphs will typically be inside one of the four main “Areas” inside a content type:\nHeader Area - Used for adding images and page titles Content Area - Where your main content goes Sidebar Area - Where you put related information, such as promotions and links to other content. Bottom Area - The “anchoring” elements of your page, such as a call to action. Not all content types use all four regions. For example, a content type use its fields to put content inside the Sidebar Area, while another may have a sidebar area but use its Image field instead of a Header Area\nTwo Ways to Add Paragraphs Content editors have two ways to add paragraphs onto a page - inline editor and admin portal.\nAdmin Portal To add a paragraph into an Area, open that area and select a paragraph from the dropdown. The button will usually be labeled with “Add [First Paragraph in List]” (the first paragraph in the list depends on the content type/area), and there will be some helper text above.\nThe video below provides an example of the functionality of paragraphs; however, the specific layouts demoed are not YMCA Website Services layouts.\nInline Editor If you’ve upgraded to YMCA Website Services 2.4 or later, you can add a paragraph from the front-end by clicking on the Plus icon in a given region and selecting a paragraph from the pop-up window.\nNote: Not all paragraphs are available for inline editing yet. More paragraphs will be added to the inline content editor in later releases\nRearranging Paragraphs Sometimes you have one layout in your head and it doesn’t look as good when you add it to your page. You can easily move around your sections by clicking on the cross icon to the left of your paragraphs. Drag around your paragraphs to rearrange.\nEditing Paragraphs Need to fix a typo? Click the edit button next to each paragraph to open it back up and make edits.\nDeleting Paragraphs Maybe you didn’t need that section. Don’t worry: you can easily delete a paragraph by clicking on the remove option from the dropdown next to where it says “Edit.”\nChoosing the Right Paragraph Type YMCA Website Services comes with more than 50 paragraph types, and depending on your partner’s customizations, you may have even more. This documentation will focus the types that come out of the box with YMCA Website Services and how to use them.\n","categories":"","description":"Embed simple text, images, blocks and interactive components with blocks, YMCA Website Services’s layout-building component.\n","excerpt":"Embed simple text, images, blocks and interactive components with …","ref":"/docs/user-documentation/paragraphs/","tags":"","title":"Paragraphs"},{"body":"The Taxonomy feature in YMCA Website Services creates organized lists of categories, which allow you to group content, create folders for Images ( in YMCA Website Services 2.4 and later) and create standard options for dropdown fields in your content.\nEach list is called a Vocabulary, while each item in your list is called a Term. Terms comprise a Term Name and any additional data/settings for that particular vocabulary (see below in Vocabularies in YMCA Website Services for details).\nHow to Edit Vocabulary Lists Go to Structure \u003e Taxonomy. When you find the Vocabulary you want to edit, click List Terms.\nYou can rearrange your terms by hovering your mouse over the cross icon and dragging them. This will determine the order in which they appear. By default these are alphabetical.\nMoving a term to the right will “nest” it underneath another term, making it a “child” to that term.\nAdding/Editing Terms Click on Edit to make changes to an existing item or Add Term to add a new one.\nOn the next page, you can add a Name for your vocabulary and an optional Description.\nBelow those two fields, you can add the additional information unique to your vocabulary.\nTerm Example - Grey Color The Color Vocabulary provides a standard list of color options across your website, such as in a background color for your header.\nTo change your shade of grey, you would go to Structure \u003e Taxonomy \u003e Color \u003e Grey.\nBelow the name of your Grey term, you’ll find a color widget where you can change your standard shade of Grey across your site.\nIn this example, you can change the color of the Grey term in the Color Vocabulary using a Color widget.\nVocabularies in YMCA Website Services Because Vocabularies are lists of categories, how they will show up depends on which Vocabulary you use.\nAmenities Used for tagging branches with amenities. Amenities display on a branch page and as a filter on a locations page.\nColor As mentioned above, Color is a list of colors you can use across your site, primarily in your page headers, small banners, galleries and banners.\nBlog/News Category These taxonomies tag blog/news posts.

We’ve provided this list to help you decide where to start.\nYouTube Free Unlimited bandwidth Security through obscurity with “unlisted” videos. YouTube videos that are smaller than 1280x720px (aka “720p”) may not display a thumbnail properly in Virtual Y. If you upload a large (greater than 1280×720px) thumbnail via YouTube’s video editor that should resolve this issue on Virtual Y (until this issue is resolved).\nSetting up a Brand account for your Y is a good first step to using YouTube for your videos.\nThe requirements for embedding YouTube Live Streams may change often. Previously this has either required having more than 1000 subscribers on your channel, turning on “Monetization”, etc. It may, at times, be more expedient to use Vimeo for Live Streaming.\nAs of February 2021, YouTube’s stated requirements for Live Streaming are:\nTo live stream, you need to have no live streaming restrictions in the past 90 days and you need to verify your channel.\nVimeo Requires a paid plan for typical Y usage. Upload and bandwidth limits based on account type. Truly gated videos with domain-level privacy. Domain restrictions are NOT RECOMMENDED if you plan on sharing your content with other Y’s using Virtual Y’s “Shared Content” feature. In order to facilitate content sharing, we recommend using the Hide this video from vimeo .com privacy option combined with Enable people to embed this video on any site. Review all of Vimeo’s privacy options. Most associations have been buying the “Premium” level to get access to unlimited live streaming.\nVimeo private videos do not allow thumbnails to be generated for your site. If you use private videos on Vimeo you’ll need to upload a thumbnail using the Teaser Image field on the content\n.\nFacebook Facebook is not recommended for Virtual Y content, as any meeting there will also be listed publicly.\nIf you choose to host virtual meetings on Facebook, they will need to be publicly listed, otherwise it is not possible to create a direct link to the event. To get the link to a public video:\nClick the three dots on the bottom right of the video. Select “Copy Link” Zoom A few notes:\nIf you are creating a recurring Virtual Meeting, please be sure your Zoom meeting recurrence matches the recurrence on the Virtual Y meeting. If your Zoom meeting requires a password, we recommend generating a link with the password embedded in it. This usually looks something like ?pwd=... in the link. Please review Zoom’s updated security settings for more information. Through many tests we determined that Zoom embeds are not reliable and support for that feature has been disabled. Zoom links now display as a “Join” button which should make for a much smoother user experience.

Committed to VY - Initial Technical Set-Up I already have an Open Y site, do I need to upgrade to get Virtual Y?\nNope, unless you’re more than a couple of upgrades behind. Our incredible developer team established a structure to allow Ys to obtain Virtual Y without undergoing a full site upgrade, saving both time and $$$. If it has been 12+ months since your last upgrade, we recommend you proceed to keep your site current with the latest features and security. This will reduce future upgrade costs (it’s more expensive to update a site that is multiple versions behind) and help prepare you for Drupal 9, which was released in February 2021.

What’s up?\nMost of the technical conversations take place on Slack in #virtual_ymca and #developers Implementation\nWatch the installation walkthrough video Get the code and analyze the readme files and other documentation in GitHub Follow the technical documentation in GitHub Implementation discussion on Basecamp (message board post) Go Live Check List (message board post) Which CRMs is Virtual Y compatible with?\nPersonify Daxko More details about Daxko Barcode Authentication here: https://community.openymca.org/t/virtual-y-daxko-barcode-authentication/825 CSV authentication available for ActiveNet and other CRMs Avocado (Salesforce) - coming Y-USA’s Nationwide Membership database If your CRM is not listed, we have a workaround solution where you can upload a CSV file of your active members’ email addresses into your Virtual Y site to grant your Virtual Y visitors access to your content. As long as you can export a basic spreadsheet of your active members, your data is likely compatible with Virtual Y. Will there be impacts to the domain?\nThere should not be any impact from your domain if you already use Open Y. If you do not use Open Y, you can create a subdomain of your choosing, such as ‘ virtualy.yourassociationname.org’ where ‘virtualy’ is the subdomain. What Web Browsers are compatible with Virtual Y?\nVirtual Y supports the most recent versions of all modern web browsers such as Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera Internet Explorer 11 and earlier are not supported due to the inability of that browser to play videos from services such as https://youtube.com. Here is YouTube’s official statement on not supporting Internet Explorer. User Activity Logs Documentation (message board post)\nSetting up Google Analytics for Virtual Y (web)\nCommitted to VY - Content Editors Does Virtual Y come with content?\nThere is demo content for you to test with, but you need to create and post your own content via the platforms mentioned in the next question. Some Ys have shared their content for all to use. Which platforms can I use to host my content for Virtual Y?\nVirtual Y works* with: YouTube - hosted and livestream Vimeo - hosted and livestream Zoom - livestream Zoom, GoToMeeting and Teams - video conferences Blogs - any content you post *Note: “Works with” means technically functional. Each video provider service, such as YouTube, manages their their own terms of use, which will guide what’s okay and what’s not. View the Open Y Team’s overview on Slack.\nFor Vimeo, is a specific account level needed to host videos to stream/pass through Virtual Y?\nMany associations have been buying the Premium level to get access to unlimited livestreaming. Again, the Open Y Team has no control over Vimeo’s terms of use, and Vimeo’s terms of use are subject to change at any point without prior notice. More details about Vimeo (message board post) Can we keep our YouTube videos unlisted on our channel but still have them play in our Virtual Y?\nYes. Can we use Facebook video links?\nNo. Due to restrictions/limitations enforced by Facebook, private videos or videos from a private group cannot be embedded on an external (non-Facebook) site. This means the only option would be to use publicly-facing Facebook Live video within Virtual Y, which can be seen by anyone on Facebook, not just your members. This weakens the case for paying for exclusive access to Virtual Y as a member, and YMCA associations were not interested in Open Y pursuing this type of Facebook integration. Can I host Les Mills classes on our Y’s YouTube channel?\nUnfortunately, Les Mills licensing does not cover recording the class for rebroadcasting. Can we use Y360 videos?\nY360 videos are owned exclusively by Y360 and then licensed by Ys. A Y would need to obtain explicit permission from them for usage within Virtual Y. Additionally, Open Y would first have to build a new integration to accept those videos as on-demand content, because Y360 uses a video hosting service other than YouTube or Vimeo. Music Licensing\nHow does music licensing work with this platform? Music licensing copyrights and restrictions originate with the video platform used (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo) so you need to follow those guidelines. Be very careful to investigate whether the music you use within your branches is OK on livestream workouts. Check out the music licensing discussion (message board post) Is YouTube strict about licensing? YES. Do not put your Y at risk. See Nathan Hippenmeyer’s comments on the CMO basecamp, which includes links to service providers for licensed music subscriptions.

Y-USA’s Role I just heard Y-USA is building a Virtual Y platform. What if I’m already building this with a developer? Virtual Y is open source software built by the Open Y. Because this software is open source, it is free for any YMCA to download and use. The Y-USA’s Y Cloud platform uses the Virtual Y module as a plug-and-play standalone micro-site that Open Y created. Y-USA’s Y Cloud provides Virtual Y as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) that includes hosting, maintenance and general support of the Virtual Y stand-alone microsite for a low monthly fee. Y-USA provides this as an opt-in option to any YMCA that may be interested. For any further questions, you can contact Y-USA at ycloud@ymca.net What’s the difference between Y-USA’s work on Virtual Y and what other partners are doing? There is no significant customer-facing difference between Y-USA’s Virtual Y SaaS solution, and other partners’ hosting solutions. The functionality should work as expected in both deployment models. Marketing Will there be an opportunity for shared content? Yes. Cross-association content sharing is available now, both for use and for you to contribute your content. Do associations have access to analytics for Virtual Y? Yes, there is a tracking log within the admin menu that displays when a user logs in, as well as which pieces of content they view. This allows you to gauge what is most popular with your members. The information can be sorted and exported for ease of use. Will there be a marketing toolkit? Ys are responsible for marketing virtual offerings. We encourage associations to share helpful tips on what marketing tactics have worked best for them on the Open Y message board, and Open Y Slack You can see what other Ys are doing by visiting our resources post. It includes recordings and decks from a number of Ys. Do you have slides or a pitch deck I can use? You bet! Here is an overview deck from our July meet-up as well as a pitch deck created by William Renderos from the Seattle Y. Virtual Y - Taking it to 11 What’s coming up for VY?

Activity Finder provides a method for sites to redirect users to register for activities. The method passes a URL in a query string, like exampleymca.org/af/register-redirect/1234?url=https://exampleactivities.com....\nActivity Finder provides a method to only allow trusted hosts to be redirected, but if no trusted host is configured then any host was previously allowed through.\nThis could provide an attack vector where a malicious site could use the “trusted” YMCA domain to redirect users to an untrusted site, like exampleymca.org/af/register-redirect/1234?url=https://examplephishers.net.\nHow bad is it? Using the Drupal Security Risk Calculator this risk has been assessed as 12/25 (Moderately Critical): AC:Basic/A:None/CI:None/II:None/E:Exploit/TD:Default.\nHere’s what that means:\nAccess complexity: It is trivial for an attacker to leverage the vulnerability. Authentication: No authentication is needed for an exploit to be successful. Confidentiality Impact: The vulnerability does not cause non-public data to become accessible. Integrity Impact: The vulnerability can not allow system data to be compromised. Zero-day Impact: An documented exploit does exist in the wild. Target Distribution: Default module configurations are exploitable, but a config change can disable the exploit. What do we do?

However, General Checks are for testing functionality for the current proposed change only, not for Regression Testing.\nFor regression testing, Behat tests in this flow are provided automatically on each build by YMCA Website Services community.\nEvery pull request should include a testing plan prior to release into YMCA Website Services. This plan should cover the testing of all workflows and functionality to ensure that they continue to work with any new code or change implemented. This is because it is possible for conflicts to occur between elements of YMCA Website Services, Drupal Modules, and Drupal Core. These pull request testing plans will increase productivity and decrease effort for manual Acceptance Testing of upcoming Releases. This testing plan should cover specific features and functionality that is likely to cause regression issues post-release or post-upgrade to the latest version of YMCA Website Services once this new code is implemented.\nExample of testing plan: If the Drupal core is updated it is important to gather all Drupal core Release Notes since last release core upgrade for YMCA Website Services and analyze important issues fixed. Example - in case if you are doing upgrade from latest 8.4.0 to 8.4.4:\nhttps://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.4.4 (translations) https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.4.3 (postgreSQL and migration) https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.4.2 (migrations, taxonomy, ckeditor) https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.4.1 (composer) This means the list of systems should be tested are\nmultilingual postgreSQL support migration taxonomy ckeditor composer This list could be extended by analyzing some highly important parts of YMCA Website Services distributions that depends from the above subsystems. It is not required to spend time on every module that has a dependency taxonomy, but it is important to test at least one impacted module to ensure it is still working post-implementation. In case if there is a Behat test already created for the subsystem in a list then a manual test could be skipped as long as the build is not failing due to the module or element covered in the associated Behat test.\nHow to choose which modules to test: These can be a random selection from the list of systems impacted, or one of the oldest modules in a system impacted. This is because there is a higher chance that a minor change could cause a regression issue for the modules that have not received recent or regular updates.\nThe oldest modules(contrib modules) that have dependencies from the above list should also be updated, but to improve productivity, these updates should only be initiated if there is a security issue or a module stopped working because of the subsystems getting updated within an upcoming release. In case if a respective module update creates more issues that the older version of said module - then it is better to keep the old module and fix an associated regression bug. Tip: usually a new version of the module already contains a bug fix, so adding a patch from the drupal.org to composer.json of the YMCA Website Services distribution is preferred to get distribution released. Keep in mind, you will need to create a follow-up task for the module to be updated after release.\nAfter creating list of modules that could introduce regression issues it is highly recommended to follow Quick-start section of the module’s readme files, that usually is shipped with modules. Example for the location_finder. In case if a module has no Quick-start or Acceptance testing section in readme - it is important to test at least one place where functionality of the module should be working. It is highly recommended to add this manual test steps as a follow-up task, new issue or even better - create Pull Request with changes to readme into YMCA Website Services repository. For the sake of performance, adding step by step how-to to the respective module’s README.md file is highly recommended. It takes only a few minutes to write a couple of lines of documentation which will greatly help others with future contributions and changes.\nOptional, but greatly appreciated: Add a Drupal tour for the how-to, created in README will benefit future YMCA Website Services users and developers. Having a tour for the business functionality is highly recommended to ship with the component - it creates an in-site visual guided documentation and helps to decrease time for the Acceptance testing.\nAnd last, but not the lease - adding Behat tests to the system will ensure functionality is tested on every pull request, on every CI build in the future.\nRule Every release of YMCA Website Services since 8.1.9 should include list of subsystems, changed in release for the community to be aware of the possible regressions on their end.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"YMCA Website Services is a big distribution with a large amount of …","ref":"/docs/development/acceptancetesting/","tags":"","title":"Acceptance Testing"},{"body":" Designs: Mobile | Desktop\nTo use the block:\nClick the Layout tab at the top of your page Scroll to the location on the page where you want to add a block Click Add block In the sidebar, click Create custom block Choose the block to add.

Out-of-the-box, YMCA Website Services’s Activity Finder integrates with Daxko, ActiveNet, and Personify. Any other CRM will require custom developer work.\nHow you use these paragraphs will depend on how your Association has structured its program data on the CRM and on how you decide to get people to program results.\nThere are three primary approaches to setting this up: a standard approach, a results-only approach, and a targeted approach.\nStandard Approach Create two Landing Pages. Title one “Find a Program” and the other “Program Search.” On the “Find a Program” page, add the “Activity Finder” paragraph. Type in “Program Search” and select your Program Search in the “Activity Finder Search Results Page Reference” field. At the bottom, you will see a field called “Title” Change the title to “Find a Program” Save the page. Next, on the “Program Search” page, add the “Activity Finder Search Results” paragraph into the Content Area. Type in “Find a Program” on the “Activity Finder Page Reference” page. Results-Only Approach If you plan on using deep-linking or want to forgo the guided search experience, you can use the “Activity Finder Search Results.” Create a Landing Page called “Program Search” using the One Column (Full Width) layout.\nAdd the “Activity Finder Search Results” paragraph into your content area and leave the “Activity Finder Page Reference” field blank. Save your page. Targeted Approach Activity Finder can also be used on multiple pages on your site, specifically on your Program Subcategory pages.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"What It Does: Embeds the Activity Finder program search experience on …","ref":"/docs/user-documentation/paragraphs/activity-finder/","tags":"","title":"Activity Finder"},{"body":" These content types format data/content pulled from third parties, such as Daxko, Personify and ActiveNet, for display in YMCA Website Services.\nContent editors rarely, if ever, enter information directly into these content types on a day-to-day basis. However, it is important to know how they work and how they relate to manually-entered content.\nExample - Swim Lessons\nSwimming and Aquatics (Program Page, manually entered) Swim Lessons (Program Subcategory Page, manually entered) Youth Group Swim Lessons (Activity, mapped from CRM or custom automation) Stage 3 (Class, mapped from CRM) Monday/Wednesday/Friday 9:30-10 a.m. at Franklin Family YMCA (Session, mapped from CRM) Note: This is an example only. Depending on your CRM and any customizations you make, your setup for Swim Lessons or any program may look different that the example listed above.\nActivity Often used as the top-level filter in Activity Finder and Repeat Schedules, Activity consists of three fields:\nTitle: The name of the Activity (and the filter in Activity Finder). Program subcategory: An entity reference to or tag for a Program Subcategory. Maps the Activity to higher-levels of user-entered content. *Description: A description for the Activity. Usually pulled from a description in a CRM through an API. Class A narrower selection of Program Offerings. Not an individual instance, but a smaller selection of instances.\nClasses have three ields that map into Activity Finder and Repeat Schedules: a description, a title and entity reference/tag to an Activity.\nClass also contains Areas for content editors to add paragraphs; however, depending on how your CRM and the number of programs your Y runs, it may not be practical use these fields.\nSession An individual program offering. Contains fields for pricing, session date/time, instructor, ages and a registration link.

Allows unlimited items but we recommend a maximum of 6-8 depending on the Link text length. Customizing with Layout Builder Beginning in Website Services 9.2.13 content editors have the option of customizing the Branch page with Layout Builder. You can migrate from using Paragraphs to using Layout Builder on a branch-by-branch basis in order to ease the transition.\nThe Use Layout Builder checkbox on the Branch edit page non-destructively switches between Paragraphs and Layout Builder.\nLayout Builder Blocks Branch pages have a number of specialized components that utilize the structured data (fields) that already exist on your branch page in newly designed Layout Builder Blocks.\nIn addition to using many of the standard Layout Builder components, Branch pages also use a number of components that display fields described above:\nBranch Hours: Combines the branch title, contact information, hours, and more into a dynamic page header. Designs: Mobile | Desktop An image can be added to the background of this block using the Style tab. Branch Amenities: Displays open and closed amenities in an easy-to-read grid. Designs: Mobile | Desktop An image can be added to the background of this block using the Style tab. Branch Menu: Displays the Branch Menu links. Designs: Mobile | Desktop One additional component is available that requires additional information:\nBranch Social Links Designs: Mobile | Desktop\nThis component allows you to place up to 6 social media links on a branch page.\nAdd the Branch Social Links block to the pre-configured Social links section of your page using the standard process. Add up to 6 links in the Links field. Icons for each social media platform will be populated automatically. Currently supported platforms include: Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin, Twitter, and YouTube. Request a new platform if you need. After adding or updating the block, be sure to save and publish your branch. Migrating to Layout Builder Migrating Branches to Layout builder involves recreating some content on the page. The process is similar to building a new Landing Page with Layout Builder, but with a lot of the work done for you!\nOnce you are ready to migrate a Branch:\nEither clone the page or open it in a separate tab so that it’s easier to compare content. Prepare the Branch for Layout Builder: Edit the Branch, Add links in the Menu section if you’d like, click Use Layout Builder, if you’d like, uncheck Published while you do the migration to temporarily hide the page, then Save. Your Branch will now display a set of default blocks: Hours (and header), Menu, Social Links, and Amenities.

When you click on the button icon, it will open a pop-up.\nYou can also edit a button you’ve created previously by clicking on the link in the text editor.\nThere are three tabs for creating your button: an info tab, a target tab, and an icon tab.\nInfo Tab This screen gives you basic options to style your link or button. On the top left “Style Option,” you will have several options to style your button or output it as a link.\nThe link option will allow you to embed your link text in line with a paragraph. In Lily, all button styles other than link default to purple. In Rose, all options except “default” will output a blue button. “Default” outputs a white button. In Carnation, the button options all output different colors. Button Guide Example: @mlefler From the YMCA of Lincoln, NE, built this guide to provide examples of possible styles for buttons. Ask your developer partner to provide you a style guide for your site.\nThe top right “Size” dropdown four options for your button size. If you chose “Link” style option, the Size option will not affect your link.\nAdd the text for your link/button in the bottom left. Enter your link in the URL field on the bottom right.\nFor links on your website, don’t use the full URL. Highlight everything beginning with the / after your .com, .org, etc. For example, for openy.org/about, you would choose /about. This is called the relative path, and it will help your analytics tracking. For links on other websites, grab the full URL, including the https://. For example, for openy.org/about, you would choose https://ycloud.y.org/open-y-association-websites/about. For email links, add mailto:example@exampleymca.org. https://www.coffeecup.com/help/articles/absolute-vs-relative-pathslinks/\nTarget Tab This tab gives you the ability to change the behavior of your link. By default, all links will have a “not set” behavior, which means the link will open in the same active tab. The other options include…\nFrame Popup New Window Topmost Window Same Window Parent Window » Learn about link targets\nIcons Tab You can add icons to your buttons or links in the icons tab. On the right, you will have fields that integrate with the Font Awesome library. To have an icon show up on the left, use the Left Icon text field. For the right, use the Right Icon text field.\nExample: For a Right Chevron, type fa-chevron-right.\nView free font awesome icons at fontawesome.com\nNote: The left field makes reference to the Bootstrap Glyphicons library. As of this documentation, this icon library has been deprecated, and the Glyphicons fields will not work in YMCA Website Services.\nBecause the button embed is an open-source tool developed by a third party, these fields will go away once the code’s maintainer updates the code.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" As an alternate to using the link tool, you can easily create buttons …","ref":"/docs/user-documentation/text-editor/building-buttons/","tags":"","title":"Building Buttons"},{"body":" The tables tool in the YMCA Website Services text editor provides the ability to create flexible tables for a number of different use cases, including displaying contact information, pricing tables, and more.\nAdding a New Table To add a table, click on the table icon. A popup will appear with your initial setup options:\nSet the number of rows and columns by typing numbers into those fields The headers field dropdown gives you options to create a header column, row, or both. This will count toward the total number of rows/columns in your table, so if you select four rows and have a header row, you will have three rows beneath that header. Set the width and height in the top right text fields. If you add no unit, the number you enter will default to pixels. The fields also support percentages (such as 100%). We recommend percentages when you’re putting table in paragraphs other than simple content. Style your table with the border size, cell size, and cell padding fields Like the Height and Width fields, units default to pixels. Align the values inside your cells using the Alignment dropdown. Add a caption to your table using the Caption field Captions will display above the table in Lily and Rose. Captions display below the table in Carnation. The summary field provides a brief description for your table for screen readers and accessibility devices. It does not print out visible text. Editing the Table To edit a table after you’ve built one, right click on the table. To access the basic table options, click on “Table Properties.”\nYou can also double-click inside a table cell.\nAdding Rows/Columns To add a row or column, right-click and go to either “Row” or “Column” in the options that appear. You can insert a row or column before or after the current row/column.\nDeleting Rows/Columns Both the row and column options allow you to delete from the right-click options as well. Just right-click \u003e Row or Column \u003e Delete Row OR Delete Column.\nTo delete multiple rows or column, just highlight the rows or columns you want to delete.\nFormatting Individual Cells/Groups of Cells The “Cell” option from the right-click menu gives you same options as Row and Column, including inserting cells and deleting cells. You can also merge cells or split cells as you would in an excel table by selecting those options from the right-click menu.\nHowever, there is another option called “Cell Properties” that allows you to style your cells as well. Just right-click \u003e Cell \u003e Cell Properties.\nThis opens a dialogue box similar to the table properties. You can set the width/height for your cell (pixels only for height; pixels or percentages for your width) in the fields on the left.\nFarther down on the left, you can choose from a dropdown whether or not to wrap the text in a cell.\nYou can also use dropdowns to set your vertical and horizontal alignments for your cells.\nOn the bottom right, you can set your border and background colors for your cells. These field support hexadecimal (#FFF) and rgba (256,256,256,1.0) color formats.\nhttps://www.pluralsight.com/blog/tutorials/understanding-hexadecimal-colors-simple\nFinally, you can edit your cells to “span” two or more rows or columns. For example, if you have a header cell you want to span two columns, you can set the “Columns Span” field to 2.\nIf you would like to apply these styling options to multiple cells, just highlight the cells you want to edit and Right-Click \u003e Cell \u003e Cell Properties.\nTable Examples To see an example of what a table might look like on your site, open the “Source” tab on your text editor and insert the HTML. You can then edit the content inside using the WYSIWYG text editor.\n// Pricing Table \u003ch2\u003eRegistration and Pricing\u003c/h2\u003e \u003ctable align=\"left\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\"

If you are an independent YMCA camp or you’re an Association with one or more locations dedicated to outdoor camp, the Camp Content Type serves well as a landing page for those locations.\n// What about Branch Day Camps? There are several considerations for Branches that host Day Camps in the center:\nThe Branch content type is intended to be the home page for branches.\nAdding a Branch listing and a Camp listing for the same physical location creates duplicate listings for your center and could have search implications.\nCamp pages don’t have fields for operating hours or amenities.\nBranch Day Camps, unlike outdoor camps, tend to be listed in the same CRM as other branch-based programs, and therefore could integrate into Activity Finder, provided the CRM’s compatibility.\nRecommended Content Types for Branch Day Camps -\u003e Learn how to use the Program Subcategory content type ⇒ -\u003e Read about Landing Pages ⇒\nHow Do I Use Camp? General Info -\u003e Title This is the name of your branch, which will display as your page title and the title in the location card.\nThere is no separate field for the full name of your facility (e.g., Joe C. Davis YMCA Outdoor Center) versus the common name (Camp Widjiwagan). The best practice would be to use the shorter, more common name for readability.\n-\u003e Menu Links Add in the URL or name of the content you want to link your Camp Menu to (must use Camp Menu for this to work).\nRead more about Camp Menu ⇒\nContact Info -\u003e Address: The physical address of your location. Be sure to include all address fields.\n-\u003e Camp coordinates This field pins your camp on the locations map.\nHow to Get Your Camp Coordinates from Google Maps\nRight click on your camp and select “What’s here?” Click on the latitude/longitude number at the bottom of the card. \u003e \u003e Below the headline, copy the first number (the non-negative number) into the latitude field. Copy the second number (the negative number) into the longitude field. \u003e \u003e -\u003e Phone/Fax/Email The fax is optional, but add the main line for your branch in the phone field.\nAdd a main contact email, such as contactmyy@anytownymca.org, rather than the email for an individual staff member.\n-\u003e Directions Link to your Google Places. Add “Get Directions” in the Link Text section.\nHeader Area There is no image field for the Camp content type, so you will need to add one of the following paragraphs to add an image and title at the top of your page:\nBanner Small Banner Gallery Below your header image, add in a Camp Menu paragraph for a secondary, full-width navigation.\nContent Area The Camp Content Type only has one layout option—one column—and no description field.

It is more technical and in-depth for specific cases that were discussed during code quality review processes the YMCA Website Services team has in place. During this process, all code should be reviewed by 1-2 developers before being merged into the YMCA Website Services codebase.\nGeneral Rules Components in YMCA Website Services (whether modules, themes, or other code structures) should be, as much as possible, reusable and atomic. All features, content types, settings, styles, etc. should be bundled together to create a cohesive component.\nGeneral naming conventions Features module naming openy_${entity_type|abbr}_${entity_bundle|abbr}_${feature|optional} Example: openy_node_blog_feature openy_prgf_sc_feature -\u003e OpenY Paragraph Simple Content (name within yml) Fields naming (\u003c=20 chars) field_${entity_type|abbr}_${entity_bundle|abbr}_{name|abbr} Example: field_prgf_sc_body All descriptions are mandatory! Module naming conventions - Depending on the context we should choose the name from this list: ${project_name|abbr}_${business_name|abbr} - when the code looks like legacy and has specifics that are not ready to be open-sourced openy_${business_name|abbr} - when the code is ready to be ejected to OpenY package ${business_name} - when the code is so abstract that it has no connection to OpenY and is ready to be hosted on Drupal.org as an independent project. Code Sharing To support reuse by the community, the MODULE-NAME should relate to the business logic of the module. It is not good to create modules by abstracting them out of the business. All modules that have been shared to drupal.org from past projects were possible to share only because they represent some feature, tied to a business need. For example:\npersonify - module for SOAP related methods for working with Personify API acrypt - Asymmetric crypt algorithm and so on.\nPHP Return early pattern To keep readability in functions and methods, it is wise to return early if simple conditions apply that can be checked at the beginning of a method:\n\u003c?php function foo($bar, $baz) { if ($foo) { // logic goes here return $calculated_value; } else { return null; } } ?\u003e It’s better to return early, keeping indentation and brainpower needed to follow the code low.\n\u003c?php function foo($bar, $baz) { if (!$foo) { return null; } // logic goes here return $calculated_value; } ?\u003e Define early pattern When you have a condition that aims to change the value of a variable without additional logic, get rid of if else elseif code and instead define your variable early and change it via conditions.\nBefore:\nif ($a = 'hello') { $text = 'Welcome to site'; } else { $text = 'Register please'; } After:\n$text = 'Register please'; if ($a = 'hello') { $text = 'Welcome to site'; } Null Checks with isset isset() verifies if set and not null. There is no need to do additional verification against NULL.\nBefore:\n... 'video' =\u003e (isset($feed['profile_media_videos']) || $feed['profile_media_videos'] != NULL) ? $feed['profile_media_videos'] : '', ... After:\n... 'video' =\u003e (isset($feed['profile_media_videos'])) ? $feed['profile_media_videos'] : '', ... Dependency Injection For the decoupled and easier to upgrade code in Drupal 8+ Dependency injection should be used instead of calling methods from services statically.\nSee the Drupal API Overview of the Dependency Injection Container and Services.\nBefore:\n... $node = Drupal::entityTypeManager()-\u003egetStorage('node')-\u003eload($result-\u003egetField('nid')-\u003egetValues()[0]); ... After:\n... $node = $this-\u003eentityTypeManager-\u003egetStorage('node')-\u003eload($result-\u003egetField('nid')-\u003egetValues()[0]); ... Creating meaningful log messages To provide useful logging for site managers, we need to write meaningful log messages with a proper context.\nBefore:\n... if($type == 'program') { if ($feed['profile_media_videos'] != NULL || $feed['profile_media_images'] != NULL) { \\Drupal::logger('272')-\u003enotice($type); ... After:\n... if($type == 'program') { if ($feed['profile_media_videos'] != NULL || $feed['profile_media_images'] != NULL) { \\Drupal::logger('form_import')-\u003enotice(\"FORM IMPORT: type is $type\"); ... Maintaining an Upgrade Path All changes in configurations should be added to appropriate hook_update_N to update already existing environments. We suggest using the Config Importer and Tools package for working with hook_update_N.\nInstall files openy.install in profile In this file, we should put updates that are related to the distribution in general and don’t fit into any feature.\nEnable/Disable module General configs openy_*.install in modules If you update some configuration for a specific feature, make sure that you put updates into this file in the appropriate module.\nConfig Management Revert only specific property from config This is the preferred method of updating configs as it will result in fewer conflicts for upgrading customized YMCA Website Services instances.\nWith config_import module we can update only part of the full config.\nFor updating specific property in config use the openy_upgrade_tool.param_updater service:\nFind the module where your config lives. Create a new hook_update_N in the openy_*.install file. In that hook add the update code (for example): $config = drupal_get_path('module', 'openy_media_image') . '/config/install/views.view.images_library.yml'; $config_importer = \\Drupal::service('openy_upgrade_tool.param_updater'); $config_importer-\u003eupdate($config, 'views.view.images_library', 'display.default.display_options.pager'); Where:\n$config variable contains path to config with config name, like: views.view.images_library - config name display.default.display_options.pager - config specific property (you can set value from a nested array with variable depth) Revert full configs This variant uses extensive config file manipulation and increases the time for an upgrade.\nFor updating full config or several configs from directory use the openy_upgrade_tool.importer service:\n$config_dir = drupal_get_path('module', 'openy_media_image') . '/config/install'; $config_importer = \\Drupal::service('openy_upgrade_tool.importer'); $config_importer-\u003esetDirectory($config_dir); $config_importer-\u003eimportConfigs(['views.view.images_library']); Where:\n$config_dir - path to directory with config views.view.images_library - config name Also you can update several configs from a directory:\n$config_importer-\u003eimportConfigs([ 'views.view.images_library', 'views.view.example_view', ]); JavaScript includes ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"This document serves as an addition to our Code of Conduct and Best …","ref":"/docs/wiki/code-review-quality-best-practices/","tags":"","title":"Code Review Quality Best Practices"},{"body":"This is a vocabulary that will be used for adding colors on the site.\nMachine_name: color\nFields Name Machine name Required Description Name drupal’s default Yes Color name.

There are cases when the latest, even stable version of dependency could be incompatible with some other functionality and it makes sense to keep the version older while functionality is in the process of upgrading.\nFor example, if, for some reason, custom_formatters 3.0 won’t be compatible with any of YMCA Website Services dependencies at the time of release, a developer can select an older beta version in order to proceed with the upgrade.\nTo select a specific version of a dependency when you do an upgrade of YMCA Website Services, add a dependency and its version alongside YMCA Website Services at the composer require... step.\nFor example:\nfrom upgrade doc\ncomposer require YCloudYUSA/yusaopeny:NEW_VERSION_HERE --no-update composer update --prefer-dist --with-dependencies --prefer-stable --no-suggest then change the dependency version\ncomposer require YCloudYUSA/yusaopeny:NEW_VERSION_HERE --no-update composer require drupal/custom_formatters:3.0@beta1 You can change any of the dependency versions without upgrading YMCA Website Services by running only the composer require... command for specific dependencies and Drupal Update DB routines afterward.\nCheck official Composer documentation about version constraints and updating Drupal modules with Composer.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"In 2020, due to changes in Drupal core release management and demand …","ref":"/docs/wiki/composer-version-constraints-for-open-y/","tags":"","title":"Composer version constraints for YMCA Website Services"},{"body":"Add import social posts to site (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter)\nHow configure import of posts from the social networks Given: As an YMCA Website Services site developer, I want to be able import posts from company’s accounts form social networks (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram) and save them as content on the site.\nHow to:\nOpen configuration page /admin/config/social_feed_fetcher_settings - Configuration -\u003e Social Feed Settings Select checkbox for needed social network and add additional settings.

You can also delete “in bulk” by ticking the checkmarks next to multiple rows of content on the content results page, selecting “Delete content” from the dropdown above the results table, and then clicking the “Apply to Selected” items.\nThis should only be done if you’re sure of which content you’re selecting to delete.\nHow to Use Open Y Fields Each content type will have different fields based on the information you need to enter, but they will generally fall into one of the following categories.\nUnformatted/“String” Text These are one-line text boxes, such as page titles. Simply enter text into the box.\nUnformatted Textbox A larger box that allows for line breaks/hard returns/paragraphs. As with the string text field, enter text in this box. These fields will typically allow you to enter longer amounts of text.\nDropdowns/Radio Buttons Select one of the options provided. Occasionally, you’ll have to click a button to apply or submit your selection.\nMultiselect Fields Like a dropdown, but you can select multiple options by holding Control (Windows) or Command (Mac) and clicking on two or more selections.\nWYSIWYG/Formatted Text Editor A textbox that styles your text visually and allows you add links and embed different types of media.\nMore on the Text Editor ⇒\nAutocomplete Field Appears like a text field, but with a little circle off the right. Used for searching content, blocks or taxonomy terms on your website.\nType in what you wish to enter, and then select from one of the optional results that appear below. Results will narrow as you type.\nLinks/Button Fields These will typically appear as a single box with two fields inside. They add a link onto a page, often as a button. The URL field is your link, which the Link Text is your call to action.’\nThe URL field supports both relative URLs for links on your site (e.g., /join for http://myymca.org/join) and full URLs for links on other sites (e.g., http://someotherymca.org/join).\nYou can also search for the title of a piece of content on your website and select a piece of content like in any other autocomplete field.\nImage Fields/Image Library You can add, edit and upload images any time you see a tab with Image in the title. To use the media browser, click the button in the image field.\nMore on Using the Image Library ⇒\nCloning Content You can clone content using the “Clone” button on many pages… or on the Content list in the site administration.\nOnce you choose to clone a piece of content you will be presented with a complex screen asking which entities you would like to clone. In general, you can leave all of the checkboxes as they are.

YMCA Digital Services with the help of YMCA of the North have developed and adopted a Syncer for Repeat Application which helps to migrate from the GroupEx PRO Public API to the Daxko Group API v1 and pulls data from GroupEx PRO to Program Event Framework.\nSee open-y-subprojects/openy_daxko_gxp_syncer for how to configure the Syncer.\nEmbedded schedules This replaces the deprecated Embedded GroupEx Pro Schedule Paragraph.\nEmbed code for GroupEx Pro schedules can be found in your GroupEx Pro admin interface.\nLook for the “New embed” toggle. Expand the options and choose any filters or colors that you prefer. Disable the “Fixed Header” option. Copy the resulting code, that will look something like this, substituting 000 for your own account number, and adding any location or category filters as needed: \u003cscript\u003e var acct = '000'; var loc = ''; var cat = ''; var stylesheet = ''; var hideLastnames = true; var jsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://\" : \"http://\"); document.write(\"\u003cscr\" + \"ipt src='\" + jsHost + \"ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7/jquery.min.js' type='text/javascript'\u003e\u003c/scr\" + \"ipt\u003e\"); document.write(\"\u003cscr\" + \"ipt\u003evar jQuery = jQuery.noConflict(true);\u003c/scr\" + \"ipt\u003e\"); document.write(\"\u003cscr\" + \"ipt src='\" + jsHost + \"www.groupexpro.com/schedule/embed/schedule_embed_responsive.2.js.php?a=\" + acct + \"' type='text/javascript'\u003e\u003c/scr\" + \"ipt\u003e\"); \u003c/script\u003e Navigate to your YMCA website. Follow the directions to add a Code Paragraph or a Code Block. Paste the embed code into your block. Save the paragraph/block and the page.

See the index of decoupled projects.\nIn 2021 the YMCA Website Services core team faced coupling blockers in the distribution during the upgrade from Drupal 8 to Drupal 9\nTo formalize the ongoing development and maintenance strategy, the YMCA Website Services core team shared its decoupling plan with the wider community in mid-2021.\nThis document elaborates on those processes.\nPolicy Every new component or sub-project of YMCA Website Services should be developed in its own repository - either on GitHub or Drupal.org. Drupal.org example: paragraph_skins GitHub Example: openy_activity_finder The decoupled project could be part of YMCA Website Services core - e.g. Activity Finder and added to YMCA Website Services profile by default, or not part of the core, e.g. YMCA Website Services Membership Framework which could be installed later. GitHub should be used when there is no strategy to make a component or project available for the wider Drupal community - that is, when it is tied to YMCA business and unlikely to be leveraged by somebody else. Drupal.org should be used when the component could be useful to projects outside of YMCA Website Services. Process for creating a new decoupled component Create a new GitHub/Drupal.org repository. Work on getting an initial release with at least beta version stability. Create a composer.json file for the component in order to be able to start using it via composer. See Virtual Y for an example. Make it available for the public via packagist.org or drupal.org as a release. Ensure podarok is added as a co-maintainer to the respective system. Suggest adding to YMCA Website Services by opening an issue. If approved, create a Pull Request adding it as a dependency in composer.json. Ensure this component is enabled in any of the packages maintained in the YMCA Website Services profile installation Ask for review and release, according to the release plan. for decoupling an existing component of YMCA Website Services Follow the steps above, but:\nAfter creating the repo, filter the selected component by running git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter ... from the latest development branch of the YMCA Website Services profile. This keeps credits of work done for this component as a part of the Code of Conduct. After separating the code, ensure the ejected code is not duplicated in the YMCA Website Services profile. Remove duplicated code in the same Pull Request in which you add the new dependency. Examples How to update module on Drupal.org Git filter-branch to get a history of changes. Change git origin to Drupal.org project. Create a new branch and push the code to Drupal.org. Create and push tag to Drupal.org. Create a release on drupal.org.

In order to minimize disruption to existing sites, we use the following process:\nDecide - Before removing components from the distribution we gather feedback from the community to protect active projects from having components accidentally removed. This is accomplished via messaging in the YMCA Website Services Slack and discussion on Monthly calls. Deprecate - Once a decision is made, we notify users that the feature will be removed soon. The deprecated component is moved from the YMCA Website Services package group to the YMCA Website Services (Deprecated) package group. For example: Deprecate Daxko Program Registration Paragraph. Deprecation notices are posted in point and quarterly releases of YMCA Website Services. Uninstall - Before removing code, components should be uninstalled via an update hook in the distribution and any hard dependencies should be removed. Uninstalls must occur at least one point (fix) release after the deprecation notice. Remove - Complete removal of the component from the codebase or composer.json should happen at least one quarterly (feature) release after the deprecation notice. Additionally, the following housekeeping steps should be taken when deprecating a component:\nThe release where the deprecated component has been uninstalled should be added to the important versions document in the Wiki. Code should be decoupled to external GitHub repositories with all history of commits, marked as openy-decoupled, and archived. UX/CX for deprecated components In order to deliver a high-quality upgrade path and keep the distribution on the bleeding edge of technologies we occasionally replace old and aged components with new ones for a better User eXperience and Content eXperience.\nIn order to achieve deprecations we have a policy that aims to provide a comfortable migration path for all components of the distribution.\nWhen we create a component that will replace an old one we must introduce a period of overlap, when both components are available in the system for some time (6-18 months usually). This allows users to have time and resources to migrate from the old to the new one before it is removed from the distribution. See the Activity Finder v3 to v4 migration. Deprecated components are moved to the deprecated modules group in the list of modules at Admin \u003e Extend. Also, we add lifecycle and lifecycle_link to the documentation in every deprecated module in order to provide enough information for the community. See Deprecate openy_gxp.info.yml. All titles of deprecated components in the Content Editing interface should be renamed to add the suffix (deprecated) to help Content Managers on a daily basis to not chose an old component and use a new one. For the majority of content components an automated migration path is expensive and sometimes even impossible, so we have a “lazy migration” practice in our community which puts the responsibility of migration on Content Managers and Strategists. Once new components are available in the distribution all editors should start using them and rebuild old pages by replacing old components with new ones. After the communicated timeframe (6-18 months) old components are removed from the distribution, but if an association needs it the component will be available as an independent—but unsupported—project. It can be supported by a 3rd-party agency or developer as long as it is needed. After the communicated timeframe (6-18 months) the Core team will remove the component from the distribution and keep it in an independent project for archival reasons. Usually, the project is marked as archived/obsolete in order to clarify that it is not supported and is possibly insecure. If the normal timeframe (6-18 months) is not achievable due to unforeseeable circumstances, the Core team will add proper notifications and tutorials for the community to help migrate in a comfortable way in a shorter period of time.

See the openy-project repository for the full process.\nThis video tutorial will walk you through how to initiate a local development environment.\nThe YMCA Website Services team has pre-built environments and walkthroughs using either Vagrant and VirtualBox or Docker and Docksal. Choose the method that you’re most comfortable with and get started!\nGathering information about your local environment To best troubleshoot issues, it’s helpful for the YMCA Website Services team to have as much information about your environment as possible. Before you ask for help, watch this tutorial on how to gather that information.\nDebugging with Xdebug in your local The Docksal project maintains detailed information for using Xdebug with VSCode, PHPStorm, and more.\nContributing Who should I specify for review? We have a best practice to get at least 2 independent reviews before merging code. Please request a review from the YMCA Website Services Lead Technical Architect (Andrii Podanenko, @podarok) and somebody else (from your team or another YMCA Website Services partner).\nWho is responsible for merging? The YMCA Website Services Lead Technical Architect (Andrii Podanenko, @podarok) is responsible for final approval, merging, and release management on the YMCA Website Services project.\nWhat labels in PRs should I use? What milestone should I specify? Why I can’t add labels or specify milestones? All of these require you to be granted Contributor access to the YMCA Website Services GitHub repository. Contact the YMCA Website Services Lead Technical Architect (Andrii Podanenko, @podarok) to get access. Labels are usually set by the YMCA Website Services Core Team.\nWhy are the steps for review in Pull Requests so important? When you send your code for review our team must know both how to review the code and what to test to verify the functionality. You are the only source of truth for how to check functionality. Adding steps for review will help the reviewer and QA team to verify that the issue is resolved.\nWhy should I add a reference to the GitHub issue in my PR description? As we are a community-led project, there may be a long time between creating an issue and resolving it in a Pull Request. The reviewer should be able to understand the context and possible discussion around the issue to be resolved with your PR. The more context we have, the better and faster we can review the request.\nIn what format should I add commits, should I add internal Jira task ID or GitHub issue? It is important to make commit messages with some sort of sense for the human to read them when digging back in history. Adding any task identifications from the project management system is allowed.\nWhat is the “DeepCode” bot? DeepCode bot is the automated, machine learning code review system that analyses huge amounts of GitHub repositories and is sometimes useful to find common issues before humans do reviews. It is helpful, but not always necessary to fix issues found by the DeepCode bot because sometimes it fails. If you see a comment be sure to read the report. If the report makes sense, then fix the issue suggested by the bot.\nBuild Automation \u0026 CI What CI processes does YMCA Website Services have in place? To get a fully working YMCA Website Services site for the code change you are about to push for review there is a build generating system installed for the YMCA Website Services GitHub repository that automatically generates a dedicated temporary website with your changes applied.\nWhy are some builds created automatically and some not? By default, builds are configured for trusted users, so if you are getting a message from the bot like\n“Can one of the admins verify this patch? Use “o+k to test” or ‘’t+est this please” for manual build execution.\"\nthen your username is not in the allowlist and somebody from the YMCA Website Services Core Team can comment to initiate a build for you. Contact @podarok to get your build generated or your name added to the allowlist.\nHow do I create a build for my PR? If you are on the allowlist then simply create a Pull Request from your fork to the YMCA Website Services repository. After up to 30 minutes you’ll receive comments with links to the generated site builds.\nWhen are builds deleted from the server? Usually, you have a day for the build to be wiped out from the server. If there is an upcoming deadline and many PRs are coming in, the lifetime could be significantly shorter, down to a couple of hours.\nWho should I contact to get logs from the build server? Andrii Podanenko @podarok or Dima Danylevskyi @danylevskyi\nWhat should I do if tests fail? If you have any concerns with reports generated by the code checkers that are used in YMCA Website Services ask YMCA Website Services Lead Technical Architect Andrii Podanenko to get them resolved. The majority of these systems are works-in-progress and it is helpful to have feedback on them.\nHow do I install YMCA Website Services on Pantheon hosting See request from a community.

After this version, drush entup stops working. In this version, we finally migrated to the core media subsystem, and before going further it is important to upgrade media by upgrading your site to this version first. 8.2.7.3 - This is a very stable Drupal 8 based YMCA Website Services with a bunch of contrib module updates. This is one of the last Drupal 8 based YMCA Website Services versions before the upgrade to Drupal 9 core. Also, in 8.2.7.0 and 8.2.7.1 we started to introduce multiple version constraints in composer.json to allow developers to choose between the minimum or latest dependency versions. This is for securing the upgrade path as well as adding flexibility for version selection if needed. 9.2.8.0 - Drupal 9 version which must be used in the upgrade path before going to 9.2.8.1+. This version added 9.0-9.1 Drupal Core and disabled deprecated components. 9.2.10.0 - Removed a bunch of unused modules from distribution. 9.2.11.3 - Last Open Y Drupal core 9.3.* release 9.2.11.4 - Technical release of YMCA Website Services ( no diff with 9.2.11.3 ) 9.2.13.0 - Pre Drupal 10 release, latest Drupal 9 release.

Go to Admin \u003e Virtual Y \u003e Virtual YMCA Settings \u003e Livechat Settings (/admin/openy/virtual-ymca/gc-livechat-settings). Review the settings, and modify if necessary. Go to Admin \u003e People \u003e Roles \u003e Add role (/admin/people/roles/add) and add a role entitled Virtual Trainer if it does not exist. Assign this role to any user who should have the ability to disable chat. NOTE: The admin user will also need to have this role set. Joining a Live Chat Visit any Live Stream event. At the time that the event starts, a Live Chat button will appear below the video. The button will not be visible before the event start time. To allow attendees to join before the meeting, set the start time to a few minutes before your actual start. All participants can enter the chat, set their name, and chat throughout the entire Live Stream event. Moderating a Live Chat At any point during a chat session, users with the Virtual Trainer role have the ability to disable the chat using the Disable Chat button. Users will see a message saying “Instructor disabled chat for users” Chat can be restarted using the Restart Livechat button on the event page, next to the chat icon. Disabling chat will remove the history of that chat from the server. Chat History Each Livestream saves its history for a certain amount of time. The default is 30 days and can be configured in the Live Chat Settings (/admin/openy/virtual-ymca/gc-livechat-settings). Chat history is saved and can be viewed at Admin \u003e Virtual Y \u003e Virtual Meeting Chat Logs (/admin/virtual-y/chats). Troubleshooting If the chat button is not appearing or the dialog displays “Chat is not available” or “Chat is not working at the moment” you will need to check with your development partner to ensure the Livechat service is properly configured on your server.
