# Working with Themes

Each Open Y theme was developed independently, either by the Open Y Core Team or by a partner for one specific Y and then contributed back. You can see demos of each theme on the [[Sandboxes]].

Each theme has its own dependencies and build processes. Please read the steps in each `README` for details.

## Inventory of themes

As of December 2021, themes [have been decoupled](https://github.com/ymcatwincities/openy/pull/2595) from the Open Y profile to independent projects on Drupal.org.
