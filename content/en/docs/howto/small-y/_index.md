## What is the Small Y template?

The Small Y template is a set of modules and themes tailored to the needs of Small YMCAs. It is designed to be a lightweight, easy-to-use solution for small organizations that need a simple, effective website.

A full working sandbox of the Small Y template is available at [https://small-y-stable.y.org/demo-ui-kit](https://small-y-stable.y.org/demo-ui-kit).

### What's different?

#### New, simplified theme

The Small Y template includes updates to the Layout Builder design system provided by VML in collaboration with the YMCA of the USA.

#### Only the most essential modules

The Small Y template is built with a small set of modules that are essential for a basic YMCA website. This makes it easier to set up and maintain, and reduces the weight of the site.

Modules and features included with the Small Y template include:

- Updated header and footer
- [Layout Builder](../../user-documentation/layout-builder)
- [Articles](../../user-documentation/content-types/lb-article)
- [Events](../../user-documentation/content-types/lb-event)
- [Branches](../../user-documentation/content-types/branch)
- [Camps](../../user-documentation/content-types/camp)
- [CKEditor 5 Text Editor](../../user-documentation/text-editor)

Any other modules or features of the distribution can be added as needed via the Drupal admin interface.

#### Additions to the main distribution

The Small Y Template provided a number of features back to the main distribution for all YMCA Website Services users to benefit from. These include:

- [Partners/Sponsors](../../user-documentation/layout-builder/partners) block now allow for partners to be split into multiple tiers.
- [Simple Text/Table](../../user-documentation/layout-builder/table) block now applies responsive table styles more consistently.
- An additional [Utility Menu](../../user-documentation/layout-builder/header-footer/#utility-menu) has been added to the Header to allow content editors to add additional links in the top right of the header.
- [Events Listings](../../user-documentation/layout-builder/event-views) and [Articles Listings](../../user-documentation/layout-builder/article-views) have been updated to include a **Number of items** field to limit the number of items displayed.
- [Alerts](../../user-documentation/content-types/alert) have a new set of styles that follow the colorway color scheme.

#### Small Y Specific Features

The Small Y template includes a few additional features that are not included in the main distribution. These are intended to simplify the setup process for small organizations and add guardrails to keep content consistent.

- Limits have been added to the number of items for the main menu and many components.
- [Breadcrumbs](../../user-documentation/layout-builder/breadcrumbs) are now automatically added to all pages.
- Additional variants have been added to the [Banner](../../user-documentation/layout-builder/banner) block. Each banner can be used with the colorway color or grey background.
  - **Tall** - for use as the primary hero banner on a page.
  - **Sub-page chevron** - for use as a secondary banner on a page.
  - **Sub-page chevron (no media)** - for use as a secondary banner on a page with no media.
  - **Sub-page frame** - for use as a secondary banner on a page with dark text on a white background.
  - **Promo** - for use as a smaller banner on a page with a call to action and no media. ![A screenshot of the banner variants listed above.](small-y--banner-variants.png)
- [Ping-pong](../../user-documentation/layout-builder/ping-pong) blocks can be added in sections using the **Ping-pong Section** content block. This allows for alternating content blocks to be added to a page with section-level formatting, instead of block-by-block formatting.
  - When adding a **Ping-pong Section**, you can choose from two sets of options for the blocks contained within in **Styles** > **Y Styles**.
    - **Image Alignment** - Choose whether the image starts on the left or right.
    - **Background colors** - Choose between a colorway, white, or grey background for items in the section. ![The Y Style options for ping-pong blocks.](small-y--ping-pong.png)
- [Statistics](../../user-documentation/layout-builder/statistics) blocks have been redesigned and have the option to be displayed with a grey or colorway background.
- [Grid CTA](../../user-documentation/layout-builder/grid-cta) blocks have their CTA buttons moved between the subheading and the items. [Icon Grid](../../user-documentation/layout-builder/icon-grid) blocks have the CTA below the items.

The Small Y template can be installed via the YMCA Website Services Installation wizard or the command line.
