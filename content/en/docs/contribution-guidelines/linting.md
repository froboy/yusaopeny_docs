## Checking for broken links

Using [linkcheck](https://github.com/filiph/linkcheck):

Linkcheck has some issues with localhost that we're working on resolving. Until then, you can set up your local site to run through [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/how-to/preview-with-cloudflare-tunnel/) and then run it.

- `linkcheck -e https://your-site-url.example.com/docs/some/path --skip-file .linkcheck_skip.txt` - run the linkchecker on internal (default) and external (`-e`) links with our custom ignore file (`--skip-file`).

## Checking markdown

Using [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2):

- `markdownlint-cli2 --fix "content/en/docs/user-documentation/paragraphs/**/*.md"` - lint and fix the Paragraphs directory
